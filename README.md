## Special Thanks

Tmktahu for creating the repository WakfuAssets, and allowing it to be used by the public

The devs working at project WakForge for helping me out with some questions:

And Markzs#9189 for his post in the forums of Wakfu about the "logical templates" of the items:
https://dev.to/heymarkkop/decoding-wakfu-s-action-effects-with-javascript-1nm2

In the end I had to do my own script to avoid the use of eval() which is unsafe and go with another approach. But the logic he explains in the post is very helpful.
